# Humanity Petitions
This plugin provides the capability to create, curate, and manage petitions alongside the [Humanity Theme](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-theme).  
By default, it stores signatory data and error logs in the WordPress database.  
It can, however, be extended to support external CRMs, databases, and logging mechanisms.  

## Minimum Requirements
This plugin requires:  
- WordPress 5.8+  
- PHP 8.2+ with the Intl extension  
- [Humanity Theme](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-theme) v1.0.0+  

## Required Plugins  
We currently rely upon CMB2 and CMB2 extensions for settings management, but our eventual goal is to remove these dependencies.  
Our full list of dependencies is below:  
- [CMB2](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2)  
- [CMB2 Message Field](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/cmb2-message-field)  
- [CMB2 Password Field](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/cmb2-password-field)  

## Usage
The quickest way to get started using the plugin is to download the zip of the [latest release](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-petitions/releases/latest), and install it via upload directly within WP Admin -> Plugins.
